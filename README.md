# What are Cellular Automata
Cellular Automata (CA) are a grid of cells where each cell changes state base on a predefined set of rules. These rules dictate a cell's state based on the state of the cells neighbors and, or the cell itself. 

A cell can take on any state chosen by the creator. For example, we may have dead (black) cells and alive (white) cells. Alternatively, we might opt to use colors to represent different states such as as red, green, blue, yellow, etc. There are infinite possibilities to choose from. These cells make up a grid that can either be 1 dimensional, i.e, a linear string of cells, 2 dimensional which would be like a checkerboard and 3 dimensional like a cube. Each of these dimensions can take any random shape or size.

## Conway's Game of Life
The Game of life was devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. As a two-dimensional cellular automaton, each cell C, evaluates the state of its eight surrounding neighbors and calculates a sum \(N\), which is then used to determine its transition based on predefined rules for moving on to the next generation. Conway viewed these cells in a unique way and they can do interesting things such as die from loneliness or overcrowding, be born under the right conditions, or remain in their current state as dead or alive.
